//! couch.rs — "Couch Review": a LAN-only, token-gated phone review page served by the desktop app.
//!
//! The owner starts it from Settings, opens the shown URL on a phone on the SAME Wi-Fi, and reviews
//! clips (listen → correct → save) from the couch. Decisions land in the same database through the
//! same functions the desktop review uses (`record_human_decision_by` + whole-row upsert), so a phone
//! review is indistinguishable from a desktop one.
//!
//! MULTI-REVIEWER. The owner names the people who will review; each gets their OWN token, and therefore
//! their own URL, identity, and undo history. Three properties make more than one reviewer safe — each
//! exists because the single-reviewer design silently broke it:
//!
//!   1. **Attribution.** Every decision records WHO made it (`speech_segments.reviewed_by`, Migration
//!      v43). One shared token made every label anonymous, so the corpus could not answer "who labelled
//!      this?".
//!   2. **Per-reviewer undo.** The undo stack is keyed by reviewer. One shared stack meant B's undo
//!      silently retracted A's last decision — a data-loss bug, not a UI wart.
//!   3. **Leases.** A clip served to one reviewer is leased to them for [`LEASE_TTL`]; another reviewer's
//!      queue skips it, and a decision on someone else's live lease is REFUSED (409). Without this two
//!      phones are handed the same clip and race each other's verdicts. Leases expire, so a reviewer who
//!      closes the page never strands work.
//!
//! Privacy stance (voice is biometric — GDPR Art. 9):
//!   * OFF by default; started explicitly per session and stopped on demand or app exit.
//!   * Serves on the LAN only in the sense that nothing is ever published or relayed — no cloud, no
//!     tunneling. (A router/firewall still defines the actual reachable network; Windows prompts for
//!     the inbound allow on first start.)
//!   * EVERY endpoint — including audio bytes — requires a per-session random token. No token, no
//!     data. Tokens are regenerated on every start, are per-reviewer, and are never persisted: stopping
//!     the server, or restarting it, revokes every link at once.
//!   * Read + review only: the API can list the queue, stream one clip's audio, record a decision,
//!     and undo it. No export, no settings, no keys, no file paths are reachable.
//!
//! Transport is plain HTTP. That is honest for a home LAN or a WireGuard tailnet, where the token never
//! crosses a network the owner does not control — and it is why this must NOT be port-forwarded to the
//! public internet: there is no TLS, and the token rides in the query string.
